# Gobricks
Small UI automation script for adding Gobricks bricks to the cart of [yourwobb](https://www.yourwobb.com/) via [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

## How to start?
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Phantomkeks/gobricks.git`
2. Run `npm ci --package-lock`
3. (Optional) Adapt the executable path of the configuration file ([defaults.js](configuration%2Fdefaults.js))
   - Get your executable path of Chrome browser by opening `chrome://version/` in your browser
   - Default is the default Chrome installation path for MacOS
4. Replace the [parts.csv](CSV%2Fparts.csv) file in the folder and stay with the file name.
   - CSV format relies on the CSV generated by [rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/)
5. Login in your Chrome browser to [yourwobb](https://www.yourwobb.com/) to give access to the cart 
6. Run `npm run start`

### Limitations:
- Not all [rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/) colors are matched to Gobricks colors at the moment
- Not all bricks have an equivalent to Gobricks

### Disclaimer
Please cross-check your cart before ordering, because this script is not free of bugs.
